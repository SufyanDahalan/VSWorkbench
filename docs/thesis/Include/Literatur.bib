    abstract = {The Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is a simple markup language used to create hypertext documents that are platform independent. HTML documents are SGML documents with generic semantics that are appropriate for representing information from a wide range of domains. HTML markup can represent hypertext news, mail, documentation, and hypermedia; menus of options; database query results; simple structured documents with in-lined graphics; and hypertext views of existing bodies of information. HTML has been in use by the World Wide Web (WWW) global information initiative since 1990. This specification roughly corresponds to the capabilities of HTML in common use prior to June 1994. HTML is an application of ISO Standard 8879:1986 Information Processing Text and Office Systems; Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML). The "text/html" Internet Media Type (RFC 1590) and MIME Content Type (RFC 1521) is defined by this specification.}

CSS1 is a simple style sheet mechanism that allows authors and readers to attach style (e.g. fonts, colors and spacing) to HTML documents. The CSS1 language is human readable and writable, and expresses style in common desktop publishing terminology. One of the fundamental features of CSS is that style sheets cascade; authors can attach a preferred style sheet, while the reader may have a personal style sheet to adjust for human or technological handicaps. The rules for resolving conflicts between different style sheets are defined in this specification.}

It is a generic, stateless, protocol which can be used for many tasks beyond its use for hypertext, such as name servers and distributed object management systems, through extension of its request methods, error codes and headers [47]. A feature of HTTP is the typing and negotiation of data representation, allowing systems to be built independently of the data being transferred. HTTP has been in use by the World-Wide Web global information initiative since 1990. This specification defines the protocol referred to as "HTTP/1.1", and is an update to RFC 2068 [33].}

isbn = {0131429019},
publisher = {Pearson Education},
abstract = {"Reading this book has filled a gap in my education. I feel a sense of completion, understand that UNIX is really a style of community. Now I get it, at least I get it one level deeper than I ever did before. This book came at a perfect moment for me, a moment when I shifted from visualizing programs as things to programs as the shadows cast by communities. From this perspective, Eric makes UNIX make perfect sense." --Kent Beck, author of Extreme Programming Explained, Test Driven Development, and Contributing to Eclipse"A delightful, fascinating read, and the lessons in problem-solvng are essential to every programmer, on any OS." --Bruce Eckel, author of Thinking in Java and Thinking in C++Writing better software: 30 years of UNIX development wisdomIn this book, five years in the making, the author encapsulates three decades of unwritten, hard-won software engineering wisdom. Raymond brings together for the first time the philosophy, design patterns, tools, culture, and traditions that make UNIX home to the world's best and most innovative software, and shows how these are carried forward in Linux and today's open-source movement. Using examples from leading open-source projects, he shows UNIX and Linux programmers how to apply this wisdom in building software that's more elegant, more portable, more reusable, and longer-lived.Raymond incorporates commentary from thirteen UNIX pioneers: Ken Thompson, the inventor of UNIX. Ken Arnold, part of the group that created the 4BSD UNIX releases and co-author of The Java Programming Language. Steven M. Bellovin, co-creator of Usenet and co-author of Firewalls and Internet Security. Stuart Feldman, a member of the Bell Labs UNIX development group and the author of make and f77. Jim Gettys and Keith Packard, principal architects of the X windowing system. Steve Johnson, author of yacc and of the Portable C Compiler. Brian Kernighan, co-author of The C Programming Language, The UNIX Programming Environment, The Practice of Programming, and of the awk programming language. David Korn, creator of the korn shell and author of The New Korn Shell Command and Programming Language. Mike Lesk, a member of the Bell Labs development group and author of the ms macro package, the tbl and refer tools,lex and UUCP. Doug McIlroy, Director of the Bell Labs research group where UNIX was born and inventor of the UNIX pipe. Marshall Kirk McKusick, developer of the 4.2BSD fast filesystem and a leader of the 4.3BSD and 4.4BSD teams. Henry Spencer, a leader among early UNIX developers, who created getopt, the first open-source string library, and a regular-expression engine used in 4.4BSD.}
